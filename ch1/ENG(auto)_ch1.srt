1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
No okay welcome back and today we're

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,580
gonna cover kind of a couple separate

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,140
like two main topics straight to the

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,120
cell first we're gonna do some kind of

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,190
cell scripting mainly related to bass

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,320
which is like this a lot most of you

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,560
will start and like in Mack like like

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,230
most Linux systems as the beef also and

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,550
it's also kind of backward compatible

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,170
through other souls like see see it's

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,519
pretty nice and then we're gonna cover

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,560
some kind of or sell tools that are

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,359
really convenient when you're boy doing

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,580
like really repetitive tasks like

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,890
looking for some piece of code them for

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,680
some elusive file a and there are very

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,719
kind of really nice built-in comments

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,120
that will it kind of really help help

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,300
you to do those things and so this

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,980
territory kind of introduce you to the

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,930
cell and like kind of like some of its

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,329
quirks sound like how you're executing

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,149
commands reacting them it they're gonna

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,610
kind of cover more about like the syntax

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,829
of where like the bible's the control

26
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,879
flow functions of set so for example

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,100
ones you're kind of drop into a cell say

28
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,750
you want to kind of define a variable

29
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,519
which is kind of kind of like one of the

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,610
first things you learn to do in a in a

31
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,680
primary language here you could do

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,830
something like foo equals bar and now we

33
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,920
can access the value of foo by doing

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,890
dollar food and that's

35
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,400
bar perfect a one quick that you need to

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,159
be aware is that like spaces are really

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,049
critical when you're dealing with bus

38
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:31,350
mainly because spaces reserved and that

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,840
will be for separating arguments so for

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,329
example something like foo equals bar

41
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,530
won't work and the the in the soil is

42
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,540
gonna tell you why is no work is because

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,430
the food common is not working like if

44
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,040
food is not exist and here where it's

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,750
actually happening we're not assigning

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,970
food to are what is happening we're

47
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,040
calling the full program with the first

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,290
argument equal sign and the second

49
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,030
argument bar and in general whenever you

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,280
are having some issues some like some

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,250
files with the spaces we do need to be

52
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,259
careful about that about you you need to

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,288
be careful about like coding strings

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,260
that so going into that how you do is

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,180
strings in bus there are two ways that

56
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,810
you can define a string you can define

57
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,019
strings using double quotes and you can

58
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:27,000
define strings using single editor using

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,680
single quotes a however for literal

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,930
strings they are equivalent but for the

61
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,180
rest they are not equal so for example

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,849
if we do equals dollar value is dollar

63
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,019
full the dollar foo is has been kind of

64
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,480
like expanded like strings to delete to

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,790
the value of the full variable in the

66
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,510
cell whereas if we do this with a simple

67
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,079
string we are just getting the dollar

68
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,170
foo as it is unlike single quotes won't

69
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,000
be replacing and again it's really easy

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,159
to kind of write a scrip assume that

71
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,049
this is kind of like Python that you

72
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,780
might be more familiar with and not

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,319
realize all that and this is the way you

74
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,599
will assign variables then a bass or

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,519
walk like control flow techniques that

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,359
we later like for loops while loops and

77
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:22,889
the only thing is you can define

78
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,609
functions and a we can access like a

79
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:29,160
function they have define here and here

80
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,650
we have the MCD function has been

81
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,160
defined and the thing is so far we have

82
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,319
just kind of seen how to execute several

83
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,239
comments by piping in to them kind of

84
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,090
saw that briefly yesterday but a lot of

85
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,769
times you want to do where is one thing

86
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,840
and then another thing and that's kind

87
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
of like the the sequential execution

88
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,319
that we get here here for example we're

89
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,810
calling the MCD function and we first

90
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,699
are calling it with the make their

91
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,010
common which is like creating dessert

92
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,609
tree a heat baller one is like a special

93
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,440
viral and this is the way that bus works

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,810
whereas in other scripting languages

95
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,930
that will be like are to be the first

96
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,810
the first item of the array are the V we

97
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,760
contain the argument in passes dollar

98
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,579
one and you know a lot of things in bars

99
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,710
will be dollar something and will be

100
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,110
reserved we will be seeing more examples

101
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,470
later and

102
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,380
we have created the folder we CD into

103
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,810
the into that folder which is kind of

104
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,210
like a very common parent that you will

105
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,420
see we will actually type this directly

106
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,190
into our soul and it will work and it

107
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,170
will define this function but sometimes

108
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,470
is nicer to kind of grab things in the

109
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,630
file and what we can do is we can source

110
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,450
this and I will execute this script in

111
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,090
your soul and load it so now it looks

112
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,360
like nothing happened but now the NCD

113
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,140
function has been defined in torso so we

114
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,020
can now some people do like MCD test and

115
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,890
now we move from the tools directory to

116
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,750
the test directory we both like we

117
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,060
created the the folder and we move into

118
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,330
it what else so I'm a result is like we

119
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,130
can access we access the first argument

120
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,090
with dollar one there's a lot more kind

121
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,670
of reserved comments for example door

122
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,440
zero will be the name of the script

123
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,680
there are two to three dollar nine will

124
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,510
be the second through the ninth

125
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,610
arguments that the word script takes

126
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,190
some of these reserved keywords are more

127
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,860
and also kind of be reggae use in the

128
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,070
cells for example dollar interrogation

129
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,669
mark we get you the error code from the

130
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,140
previous common a and which I will also

131
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,000
explain briefly but for example dollar

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,860
underscore will get you the last

133
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,470
argument of the previous comment so

134
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,370
another way we will have done the issues

135
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,460
we will have say like egg came a little

136
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,400
test and instead of kind of rewriting

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,100
test we can access that last argument as

138
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,040
part of the using the dollar dollar

139
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,840
underscore like that will be replaced

140
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,720
with test and now we go into tests in

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,800
there are a lot of them this will kind

142
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,240
of familiarize with them another one I

143
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,330
often use is kind of it's called bang

144
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,460
bang you will run into this whenever you

145
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,590
for example are trying to create

146
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,990
something and you don't have enough

147
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,180
permissions then you can do suit

148
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,150
bang-bang and then that will replace the

149
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,300
common in there and now you can just try

150
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,860
doing that and now it will prompt you

151
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,300
for password because you have sudo

152
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,210
permission um before I mentioned the

153
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,030
kind of the error command yesterday we

154
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,560
saw that in general there are like

155
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,530
different ways a process can communicate

156
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,150
with kind of all our processes or

157
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,060
comments we mentioned the standard input

158
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,370
which was it was like the less than like

159
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,259
getting stuff through this entire input

160
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,270
getting putting stuff into the standard

161
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,610
output there are kind of a couple more

162
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,960
interesting things it's also like a

163
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,630
standard error a stream where you kind

164
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,310
of write errors that happen with your

165
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,139
program and you want to pollute the

166
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,120
Easterner output it's also the error

167
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,759
code which is kind of like a general

168
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,650
thing in other foreign languages of like

169
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,660
some kind of way of reporting how the

170
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,190
entire run of something when so if we do

171
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,710
something like echo hello and we like

172
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,050
wait for the value is zero and it's here

173
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,940
because everything went okay anyone

174
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,300
where any issues and a zero exit code is

175
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,070
the same as you will get in a language

176
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,530
like C like Cu means everything went

177
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,510
fine there are no errors however

178
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,729
sometimes things won't work like

179
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,080
sometimes like we try to grab for fubar

180
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,729
in or or MCD Script and now we check for

181
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,190
the value is one and that's because we

182
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,889
try to search for a fuller string in the

183
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:13,780
MCD script and it wasn't there

184
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,990
so like the grep doesn't bring anything

185
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,750
but lets us know the things didn't work

186
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,389
by giving us like a one error code and

187
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:24,550
there are some interesting comments like

188
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:29,259
true for example we always have zero

189
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,219
error code and false will always have

190
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,078
one error code and then there are like

191
00:08:38,078 --> 00:08:40,240
these logical operators that you can use

192
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,610
to do some sort of like conditionals for

193
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,100
example one way you also have ifs

194
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,320
analysis that will clear but you can do

195
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,510
something like false and oops fail so

196
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,810
here we have to come

197
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,680
connected by this or appear what boss is

198
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,080
gonna do here is gonna execute the first

199
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,460
one and if the first one being working

200
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,110
just gonna execute the second one so

201
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,690
here we get it because the like it's

202
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,790
gonna try to do the logical or if the

203
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,160
first one didn't have a serial called in

204
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,630
is gonna try to do the second one

205
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,930
similarly if we instead of use false we

206
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,570
use something like true since true will

207
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,029
have a serial code then the second one

208
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,760
will be short circuit and we don't it

209
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:34,700
won't be printed similarly we have an an

210
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,150
operator which will only execute the

211
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,400
second part if the first one like run

212
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,570
without errors and this same thing will

213
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,550
happen if the first one fails then the

214
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,980
second part of this demon won't be

215
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,360
executed a kind of not exactly ready to

216
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,790
that but another thing that you will see

217
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:03,560
is that no matter what you execute then

218
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,510
you can concatenate commands using a

219
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,000
semicolon in the same line and that will

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,589
always spread beyond what we haven't

221
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:14,330
seen for example is how will you go

222
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,630
about doing kind of getting the output

223
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,420
of a common into a viable and the way we

224
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,990
can do that is doing something like this

225
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,630
where what we're doing here is we're

226
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,360
getting the output of the PWD comment

227
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,030
which is just printing the present

228
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,380
working directory where we are right now

229
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,839
and then we're storing that into the

230
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,280
full bio so we do that and then we as

231
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,280
for full we were string and more

232
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,550
generally we can do this thing called

233
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,810
common substitution or but putting it

234
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,459
into any string and since we're using

235
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,500
like double quotes instead of single

236
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,800
quotes the thing will be expanded and it

237
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,130
will tell us that m we are in this

238
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,970
working folio a another interesting

239
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,610
thing is right now what

240
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,350
this is expanding this to a string

241
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,350
instead of kind of like M this is the

242
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,480
spending as a string underneath T and

243
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,060
like lesser known tool is called process

244
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,550
substitution which is kind of similar

245
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,250
where we will do and it will hear for

246
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,510
example the less than parenthesis some

247
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,670
command and another parenthesis that

248
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,410
will do is that will execute that will

249
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,390
get the output to kind of like a

250
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,550
temporary file and you will give the

251
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,459
file handle to the common so here what

252
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,160
we're doing is we're getting where LS in

253
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,690
the directory cannot put it into a

254
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,940
temporary file doing the same thing for

255
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,410
the pine folder and then we're

256
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,620
concatenating both files and this we

257
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,360
might be really handy because some

258
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,570
comments instead of expecting the input

259
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,670
coming from the STD in they are

260
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,040
expecting things to come from some file

261
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,149
that is giving some of the arguments so

262
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,760
we get kind of both things concatenated

263
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,600
a thing like so further has been a lot

264
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,310
of information let's see kind of like a

265
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:20,149
simple like an example X script where we

266
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:24,019
see a few of these things so sample here

267
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,529
we're having like a string and we have

268
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,410
kind of this door date don't date is a

269
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,209
program so again there's a lot of

270
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,670
programs in UNIX you will kind of slowly

271
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,709
familiarize with a lot of them they just

272
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,440
prints a what the current date is and

273
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,500
you can specify different formats a then

274
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,079
we have these doors here here Toller CU

275
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,880
is the name of the script that we're

276
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,500
running then we have bowler has does the

277
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,750
number of arguments that we are giving

278
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,269
to the common and then dollar dollar is

279
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:01,610
the process ID of this common dairies

280
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,160
front again there's a lot of kind of

281
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,720
these dollar things they're not

282
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,430
intuitive because they don't have like a

283
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,680
mnemonic way of remember if maybe torah

284
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,010
has but it can be you just kind of have

285
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,269
really seen them and get familiar with

286
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:14,480
it

287
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,720
here we have this dollar at and that

288
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,459
will expand to all the arguments so

289
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:21,680
instead of having to assume that may

290
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,930
say we have three arguments and ready in

291
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,810
dollar one or two or three if we don't

292
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,460
know how many arguments we can put all

293
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,460
those arguments there and that has been

294
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,800
given to like a four and the four loop

295
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,170
will in time get like the file viable

296
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,320
and it will kind of be given it's one of

297
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,709
the arguments so what we're doing is for

298
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,690
every one of the arguments were given

299
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,830
then in the next line we are running the

300
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,440
grep common which is search for a

301
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,050
substring in some file and we're

302
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,360
searching for the string fubar

303
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,070
in the file here we have kind of put the

304
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,680
variables of the file to expand and

305
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,990
yesterday we saw the like if we care

306
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,720
about the output of a program we can

307
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,880
redirect it to somewhere to save it or

308
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,700
like to connect it to some other file

309
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,010
key but sometimes you want the opposite

310
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,470
sometimes here for example we care we're

311
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,360
going to care about the error code about

312
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,950
this script we're going to care whether

313
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,920
the crap run successfully or it didn't

314
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,740
so we can actually be scarred and

315
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,950
tiredly what the output like both the

316
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,110
standard output and standard error of

317
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,560
the grab comma and what we're doing is

318
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,529
we're redirecting the output to deafen

319
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:44,930
all which is kind of like a special

320
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,600
device in in UNIX systems where you can

321
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,330
like write and it won't it will be

322
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,890
discarded like you can drive no matter

323
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,810
how much you want to there and it will

324
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,140
be discarded and here's the kind of the

325
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,339
grate and our symbol that we should just

326
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,770
tell you for project in the output here

327
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,770
you have like a to greater than and as

328
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,240
some of you might have guessed by now

329
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,400
this is for erecting the standard error

330
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,529
because those those two streams are

331
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,740
separate and you can have to tell bus

332
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,950
what to do with each one okay so here we

333
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,959
run with check if the file has fuller

334
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,810
and if the file has fewer than it's

335
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,089
going to have a serial code if it

336
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,500
doesn't have four words gonna have a

337
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,579
non-spherical

338
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:28,149
so that's actually what we check in this

339
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:32,450
if part of the common we say get me the

340
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,640
error code again this dollar question

341
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,279
mark

342
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,319
and then we have a comparison operator

343
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,730
which is an e for not equals unlike some

344
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,490
other primal images we do have kind of

345
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,790
like equals equals behind equals these

346
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,209
symbols in Bath's they're like kind of

347
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:53,790
like a reserved set of comparisons and

348
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,110
it's mainly because there's a lot of

349
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,660
things you might want to test for when

350
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,220
you're in the cell here for example

351
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,009
we're just taking probably two values to

352
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:04,110
into your values being the same or for

353
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,519
example here the minus F check will let

354
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,559
us know if a file exists which is

355
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:12,809
something that you will run into very

356
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:17,730
very commonly I'm going back to the

357
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:23,160
example then what happens when we what

358
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,850
happens when we go into if the file did

359
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,629
not have fubar like there was like an

360
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,129
nonzero error code then we print like

361
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,540
this file doesn't happen if we were

362
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,540
we're going to add one and what we do is

363
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,889
we echo this like has four hoping this

364
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:43,350
is a comment to the file and then we're

365
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,449
using the privacy of like greater

366
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:47,879
gradient to append at the end of the

367
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,149
file and here since the file is has been

368
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:53,129
fed through the script and we don't know

369
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:55,019
beforehand we have to substitute the

370
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,170
Bible of the filename a we can actually

371
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,899
run this we already have like correct

372
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,480
permissions in this script and we can

373
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,490
give a few example you have like a few

374
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,949
files in this folder and CD is the one

375
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,898
we we saw the beginning for the MC

376
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,209
function like some script function and

377
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,270
we can even feed it the own like script

378
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,970
to itself to check that like it has four

379
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,109
in it and we run it and we first we can

380
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,819
see that like this different like

381
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,600
variables that we saw that we have been

382
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,510
successfully expanded we have date has

383
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,840
been replaced to the current time then

384
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,240
were running this program with three

385
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,850
arguments this random and PD and then is

386
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:47,039
telling us om CD doesn't have any fours

387
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,310
we are having a new

388
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,590
and this the business profile doesn't

389
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,140
have one so now for example look sue MCD

390
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,950
has big comment that we were looking for

391
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,060
and one other thing to know when you're

392
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,760
kind of executing these scripts is that

393
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,900
here we have like three completely

394
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,420
different arguments but very commonly

395
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,000
you will be given like arguments that

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,450
can be more succinctly given in some way

397
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,320
so for example here if we wanted to

398
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,750
refer to all the dot s8 scripts we will

399
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,740
just do something like less asterisk

400
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,370
Doris aids and this is a way of kind of

401
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,920
finding expansion that most cells have

402
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,740
is called gloving and here as you might

403
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,060
expect this is gonna say Oh

404
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,700
anything that has any kind of sort of

405
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,080
characters and end up with effects so

406
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,610
unsurprisingly we get kind of example

407
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,090
estate and insidious AIDS we also have

408
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,730
this project one and predict - and if

409
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,990
they were like we can do like a project

410
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,600
for it - for example more and now if we

411
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,970
just want to refer to the prey that have

412
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,730
a single character but not two

413
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,500
characters at the wall so like any other

414
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,210
character we can use the question mark

415
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,030
so question mark will expand to only a

416
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,540
single one and we get like enough where

417
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,660
LS in first pretty one and then a

418
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,920
project - they're all kind of like the

419
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,720
globe in can be very powerful you can

420
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,250
also kind of combine it a the a common

421
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,110
pattern is to use what is called curly

422
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,560
braces so let's say we have an image now

423
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,090
we have in this folder and we want to

424
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,500
convert this image from PNG to jpg or we

425
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,570
call it maybe like copy it or it's like

426
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,120
Greek common peroneal have two more

427
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,980
arguments are fairly similar and you

428
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,960
want to do something about something

429
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,970
with them as arguments to some common

430
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,940
you could do it this way or more

431
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,470
succinctly you can just do in

432
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:09,529
the open curly bracket then PNG jpg and

433
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:11,610
hearing it and getting kind of some

434
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,710
color feedback about what this will do

435
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,730
is click expand into the line above and

436
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,279
actually can like a cease it to do that

437
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:24,389
for me and that what's happening here

438
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,669
this is really powerful so for example

439
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:29,370
you can do something like we will do

440
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,519
that's unlike a bunch of fools and all

441
00:20:32,519 --> 00:20:37,769
of these will be expanded you can also

442
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,289
do it at several levels and you will do

443
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:44,789
the Cartesian yeah we have something

444
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:48,870
like this a we have one group here that

445
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,000
is like one comma two and then here is

446
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,370
like one two three and this is going to

447
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,960
do kind of the Cartesian product of

448
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,259
these two expansions and it will expand

449
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,669
into all these things that we can

450
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:07,700
quickly touch you can also combine the

451
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,909
asterisk Club with the curly braces Club

452
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:14,370
you can even use kind of ranges of like

453
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,789
we can do like MKV you and we create the

454
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:21,299
full and there were directories and then

455
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,799
we can do something along these lines

456
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,710
this is going to expand to full a full

457
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,169
be like all these commissions through J

458
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:34,950
and then the same for bar like and

459
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,720
haven't really tested budget like we're

460
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,730
getting all these combinations that we

461
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,970
can touch and now if we touch something

462
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:48,149
there is different between these two we

463
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:53,779
can again so case the these subtle the

464
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,009
the process substitution that we saw

465
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:57,629
earlier say we want to kind of check

466
00:21:57,629 --> 00:21:59,759
what files are different between these

467
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,500
two folders for us it's obvious video

468
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,320
soil because is x and y but we can ask

469
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,289
the cell to do this diff for us between

470
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:10,320
the output of one LS on your LS and of

471
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,019
unsurprisingly we're getting like X is

472
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:14,790
only in the first folder and why

473
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:21,270
only in the second polar what is more is

474
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,390
right now the the have fun kind of seen

475
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,330
baskets if you like other scripts like

476
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,940
for some task bus it's probably not best

477
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,460
it can be tricky you can actually read

478
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,140
scripts the interact with the cell

479
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,270
implement in a lot of different

480
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,860
languages so example let's see here

481
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,230
Python script you have a magic line at

482
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,330
the beginning that not explained it for

483
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,630
now then we have like import sis it's

484
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,120
kind of like the Python it's kind of not

485
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,710
by default trying to interact with the

486
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,240
cell so you will have to import some

487
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,220
library and then we're doing a really

488
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,520
silly thing of just iterating over this

489
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:07,380
cyst or art va1 semicolon which is door

490
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,090
art v is kind of similar to what

491
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,530
embossed we were getting us like the

492
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,960
dollar zero dollar one etc Sara it's

493
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,730
like the factor of the arguments we're

494
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,590
fading we're printing in in the reverse

495
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,610
order and the magic line at the

496
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,100
beginning is called a Steven and is the

497
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,800
way that the cell will know how to run

498
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,150
this program like you can always do

499
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:32,070
something like a Python script and then

500
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,130
like ABC and that will work like I

501
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,860
always like that but what if we want to

502
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,650
make this to be executable from the cell

503
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,080
the way the cell knows that it has to

504
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,020
use Python as interpreter to run this

505
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,200
file is using that the first line and

506
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,910
first line is giving it kind of the path

507
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,830
to where duckling lips

508
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,910
a-alright you mind not not like

509
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,010
different scenes will have probably

510
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,200
different places where they put Python

511
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,240
and you might not want to assume where

512
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,940
pythons install or any other interpreter

513
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:16,500
so one thing that you can do is use the

514
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,650
end comment so it's done you cannot you

515
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,720
can also give arguments in this event so

516
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,090
what we're doing here is specifying our

517
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,270
run the end comment that is for pretty

518
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,060
much every

519
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,860
system electronic system but like for

520
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,690
pretty much every system is called is in

521
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,760
user bin where a lot of binaries live

522
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,340
and then we're calling it with the

523
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,710
argument Python and then that we make

524
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,160
use of the a path environment variable

525
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,720
that we saw in the first lecture it's

526
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,820
gonna search in that pub for thee by the

527
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,760
memory and then is gonna use that to

528
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,620
interpret this file and that will make

529
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,630
this more portable so they can be run in

530
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,690
my machine and your machine and some

531
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:11,220
orbs another thing is that the bus lag

532
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,380
is not really like more than how big it

533
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,480
was developed a while ago and sometimes

534
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,030
think a bit tricky to debug and like by

535
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,120
default the the the waste will fail

536
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,160
sometimes are intuitive like the way we

537
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,320
saw before of like foo common not

538
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,750
existing sometimes is not so there's

539
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,420
like really nifty tool that we have

540
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,450
linked in the electro node which cold

541
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,720
salt tech that will kind of give you

542
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,150
both warnings and like syntactic errors

543
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,920
sort of things that you might not have

544
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,390
or it properly

545
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,030
I might misfire you have like a spaces

546
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,070
in your files so for example for

547
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:51,250
extremely simple em City I say it's file

548
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,440
we're getting a couple of furs saying

549
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,510
like hey so presently we're missing a

550
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,300
statement like this minor interpret

551
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,770
correctly if you're running the

552
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:03,490
different system also this CD is taking

553
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,760
a common and it might not expand

554
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,430
properly so instead of using CD you

555
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,860
might want to use something like CD and

556
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,040
then an or and then an exit we go back

557
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,810
to what we explained earlier what this

558
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,510
is what this will do is like if the CD

559
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,120
doesn't end correctly you cannot see D

560
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,950
into the folder because either you don't

561
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,620
have permissions doesn't exist that we

562
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,430
give an on C like a nonce your error in

563
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,830
common so you will execute exit and I

564
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,420
will like a stop the script instead of

565
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,250
like continue executing assuming you're

566
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,140
in that place that you are actually not

567
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,320
it

568
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,190
and I could have interested but the I

569
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,340
think we can check for the example set

570
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,940
and here we're getting that we still be

571
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,070
you see we should be checking the exit

572
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,200
code in a different way because it's

573
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,190
probably not the best way doing this way

574
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,950
hey one last remark I want to make is

575
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,250
that when the robust scripts they're

576
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,320
like oh like functions for them where

577
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,240
this kind of like a difference between

578
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,720
writing bass scripts in isolation like a

579
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,399
finger you're gonna run I think they're

580
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,679
you're gonna load into yourself we will

581
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,190
see some of this in the common line

582
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,700
environment lecture where we kind of be

583
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,490
tooling with the bass RC and the CC hrc

584
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,120
but you know the if you make changes to

585
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,490
for example where you are like if you CD

586
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,919
into app a script and you just execute

587
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,649
the bus trip it won't CD into the cell

588
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:42,120
WR right now but if you have loaded the

589
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,250
code directly into yourself for example

590
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,519
we loaded these we source the function

591
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,559
and then you execute the function then

592
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,570
you will get those side effects and the

593
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,870
same goes for defining variables into

594
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,759
the cell and now I'm gonna kind of talk

595
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,779
about some tools there are things like

596
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:06,259
committee when working with the solo if

597
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,299
the first we was also briefly introduced

598
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:12,389
yesterday how do you know like what

599
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,820
flags or like what except comments can

600
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,379
do like how I am supposed to know the

601
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:20,940
like LS minus L less the files in a list

602
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,960
format of like if I do move - I it's

603
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,750
gonna like prom me for stuff that what

604
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,970
you have is the man command and the man

605
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,549
command we kind of have like a lot of

606
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,159
information of how will you go about so

607
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,350
for example here we will explain for the

608
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:41,970
- I flag there are all these options you

609
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,789
can do and that's actually pretty useful

610
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,940
and it will work not only for kind of

611
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,590
really simple comments that kind of

612
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,500
compact it with your OS but will also

613
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,850
work with some

614
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,950
tools that you install from the internet

615
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:58,380
for example if the person that did the

616
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,530
installation I made it so that the man

617
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,539
pages were also installed so for example

618
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,480
of tools that were gonna cover in an a

619
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,980
bit which is called brick brick brick

620
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,510
rep and is call with Rd like this didn't

621
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,059
come with my system but it has installed

622
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,370
its own man page and I have it here and

623
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,840
I can access it a for some comments the

624
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,169
man page is useful but sometimes can be

625
00:29:25,169 --> 00:29:28,409
tricky to decipher because it's more

626
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:30,570
kind of like a documentation and a

627
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,820
description of all the things the fool

628
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,030
can do but not sometimes it will have

629
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,860
example but sometimes not and sometimes

630
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,760
the tool can do a lot of things so a a

631
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,299
couple of good tools that I use commonly

632
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,909
are combat or ffs mpg which deal with

633
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:50,549
images and video respectively and the

634
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:52,710
Muppets are like enormous so it's like

635
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,110
one neat tool called the ldr that you

636
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,799
can install and it will have like some

637
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,210
nice kind of explanatory examples of how

638
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,760
you want to use this comma and you can

639
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,070
always Google for this but I find myself

640
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,770
saving like going into the browser

641
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,140
looking about some examples and coming

642
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,299
back where like the earlier are like

643
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:17,130
kind of community contributed and they

644
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,679
they're like figley useful then like the

645
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,610
the one for FM Vee has a lot of useful

646
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,530
examples are like more nicely formatted

647
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,809
if you don't have like a huge font size

648
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,559
for recording a poor even simple

649
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:33,419
commands like tired I have a lot of

650
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,610
options that you are combining so for

651
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,980
example here you can be combined into

652
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,850
three different flags and cannot be

653
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,559
obvious when you want to combine

654
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:48,570
different ones that's how you kind of

655
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,730
will go about kind of finding more about

656
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:54,990
these tools a topic of finding let's try

657
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,830
using how to find fast like you can

658
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,240
always go less unlike we can go like

659
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,160
last project one and

660
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,710
keep a lesson all the way through but

661
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,860
maybe where we already know that we want

662
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,600
to look for all the folders called

663
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,120
SRC then this is probably a bit common

664
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,970
for doing that and that's fine like fine

665
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,030
stool the prima comes if every UNIX

666
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:31,500
system and find we're gonna give it the

667
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,750
here we're saying we want to call find

668
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,160
in the current folder

669
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,800
remember that dot stands for the current

670
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,050
folder and we want the name to be

671
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,140
searched and we want the type to be a

672
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,280
directory and by typing that is gonna

673
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,900
recursively go through the current

674
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,480
directory and look for all these files

675
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,940
of folders in this case that match this

676
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,810
part and fine has like a lot of useful

677
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,990
flux so for example you can even test

678
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,560
for the path to be in a way here we're

679
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,350
saying oh we want some number of folders

680
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,030
we don't really care that many folders

681
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,300
and then we care about all the python

682
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,890
script like all the things with the

683
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,980
extension dot pi they are within a

684
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,050
tasteful and we also check in just in

685
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,670
cases recently but we're checking just

686
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,460
that is also a type F which stands for

687
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,830
five and we're getting all these files a

688
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,140
you can also use different flags for

689
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,970
thing they are not like the path or the

690
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:38,140
name you could check things that have

691
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,540
been modified like m time is for like

692
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,010
the modification time things that have

693
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:44,530
been modified in the last day which is

694
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,480
gonna be pretty much everything is gonna

695
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,940
print a lot of the files we create and

696
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,340
files that were already there and you

697
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,430
can even use all things like size the

698
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,200
owner permissions you name what is even

699
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,660
more powerful is fine can kind of find

700
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,000
stuff but it also can do stuff when

701
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,250
would you find those files so we could

702
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:13,630
look for all the files and a half like a

703
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,020
TMP extension which is like a temporary

704
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,400
extension and

705
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,520
we can't find that like for every one of

706
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,480
those files just execute the RM common

707
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,059
for them and that will just be calling

708
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,350
RM with all these files so let's first

709
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,960
execute it without and then we execute

710
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,890
it with it again as we like the common

711
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,590
line philosophy it looks like nothing

712
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,550
happened but since we have non zero

713
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,190
sorry I see your error code something

714
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,720
happen it's just like everything when

715
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,610
correct and everything is fine and now

716
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,460
if we look for these files they're in

717
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,080
there anymore

718
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,510
I know nice thing about BA about the

719
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,100
selling journal is that like there are

720
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,010
like these tools but people will keep

721
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,350
finding new ways or like alternative

722
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,780
ways of writing these tools and it's

723
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,399
kind of nice to know about it so for

724
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,790
example find if you just want to match

725
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,330
like the last like the things up and in

726
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,330
TMP can be sometimes weird to do this

727
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,370
thing like it has like a long common and

728
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,239
there is like things that I get thee for

729
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,610
example there is like a sorter comment

730
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,949
that by default we used frag X and you

731
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,350
will ignore your get file so you don't

732
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,290
like search even for them and it will

733
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,810
color code it will have like a barrier

734
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,149
Unicode support it's like nice to know

735
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:45,520
about some of these tools but again the

736
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,870
main idea is that in if you are aware

737
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,540
that these tools exist you can save

738
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,190
yourself a lot of time from doing kind

739
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:58,810
of menial and repetitive tasks another

740
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,550
comment to bear in mind is like fine

741
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,320
like for some of you may be wondering

742
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,570
like fine is probably yes it's actually

743
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,450
going through directory structure and

744
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:10,150
looking for the things but what if I'm

745
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,100
doing a lot of fine so they wouldn't be

746
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,810
better doing kind of like a database

747
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:17,290
approach and like build an index first

748
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,500
and then use the index and update it in

749
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,570
some way well actually most most UNIX

750
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,880
systems already do and this is through

751
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,870
the locate

752
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:31,450
comment and the way that the locate you

753
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:31,810
will

754
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,620
we usually will just look for paths in

755
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,830
your file system that have the substring

756
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,650
the york and i actually didn't know if

757
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,830
it will work okay working let me try to

758
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:51,300
do something like missing semester

759
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,890
you're gonna take awhile but the

760
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,570
suddenly like you found all these file

761
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,070
there are somewhere in my file system

762
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,260
and in the house like built and index

763
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,070
already on them is much faster and then

764
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,280
to like keep in a daily decision like

765
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,180
the update vbe comment that it is

766
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,650
running through cron to update this

767
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,610
database a finding files again is like

768
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,950
really useful sometimes you're actually

769
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:23,380
concerned about not the files themselves

770
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,040
but the content of the files for that

771
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,570
you can use the grep command that we

772
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,420
have seen so far so you can do something

773
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,010
like grep for in MCD is there what if

774
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,010
you want to again like find recursive

775
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,530
search through the current structure and

776
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,810
look for more files right like we don't

777
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,870
want to do this manually we produce fine

778
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,690
and the exact but actually grab has like

779
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,840
the minus capital r flag that will go

780
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,400
through the entire a directory here and

781
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,050
it's telling us that oh we have the four

782
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,200
line in example a sites of these three

783
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,380
places and in this or two places in for

784
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,820
a it this can be really convenient when

785
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,920
mainly kind of the use case for this is

786
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,620
you know you have written some code in

787
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,320
some like prime languages and you know

788
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,660
it's somewhere in your file system but

789
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,340
you actually don't know but you can

790
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,310
actually quickly search so for example i

791
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:37,990
can quickly search for all the Python

792
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,650
files that I have in my scratch folder

793
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,580
where I use the like request library

794
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,860
and if I run this like it's giving me

795
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,040
like through all these files exactly

796
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,800
what line it has been found and here

797
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,410
instead of using grep which is fine like

798
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,290
you could also do this I'm using Riblet

799
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,190
which is a kind of like the same idea

800
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,410
but again trying to bring some more

801
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:09,880
niceties like color coding or file

802
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,510
processing and all things like has also

803
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,270
very unicode support has it's also

804
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,150
pretty fast we are not playing like a

805
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,980
trade-off unlike this being slower and

806
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,570
there's a lot of useful Flags like you

807
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,790
can say oh I actually want to get some

808
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,270
context around those results know if it

809
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,030
committed so yes so I want to get like

810
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,570
five lines of context around that so you

811
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,810
can say like see where that import lists

812
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,450
and see kind of go around it here in the

813
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,980
import isn't really useful but like if

814
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,390
you are looking for where you use the

815
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:50,500
function for example a it will be it's

816
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,130
pretty handy we can also do things like

817
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:59,320
a we can see it for example here some

818
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,480
like a more advanced use we can say is

819
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,530
you is for like don don ignore like

820
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,860
hidden files a sometimes that that can

821
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,870
be then like you would tell me you want

822
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,330
to be knowing a hidden file ciphers you

823
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,170
want shirt config files of that that

824
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,810
like by default hidden then instead of

825
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,470
printing the matches we're asking to do

826
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,360
something that will be kind of hard I

827
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,820
think to do with grep out of like my

828
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,100
head which is I want you to print all

829
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,430
the files that don't match the partner

830
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,220
giving you which may be a weird thing to

831
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,220
ask you but then we keep going and this

832
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,520
parent here is like a small red X which

833
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,800
is saying no the beginning of the line I

834
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,980
have a house and a bang and that's a

835
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,170
seeming like that we're searching here

836
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,200
for all the files that don't I don't

837
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,360
have a seat and then we're giving it

838
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,490
like here like am

839
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,320
t-minus aside to only look for like a

840
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,390
sights files because maybe you're like

841
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,060
all your all your Python or text files

842
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,610
are fine we felt like a sieve and here

843
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,770
is telling us all like McD's obviously

844
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,570
missing as even a we can even they have

845
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,520
like some also tonight's flag so for

846
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,220
example if we include the status flag

847
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:30,160
I don't read actually it will get all

848
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,080
these colleges also but it will also

849
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,240
tell us like information about like all

850
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,560
the things that I searched for example

851
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,870
like the number of mats the matches that

852
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,540
I found max lines the file died certs

853
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,010
the writer printed etc a similar as with

854
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,550
every sometimes is not as useful mmm

855
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,740
using one specific tool or another and

856
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,440
in fact as regrip there are like several

857
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,050
other tools like AK easy or you know

858
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,850
kind of grep alternative that was

859
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,820
written it was like the silver searcher

860
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,240
ad it was another one and they're all

861
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,740
pretty much interchangeable so like

862
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,780
maybe you're a system that has one or

863
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,820
not the other just knowing that you can

864
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,160
use these things with these tools can be

865
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,700
pretty useful lastly I want to cover

866
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
kind of how you go about not finding

867
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,930
files or code but how do you go about

868
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,660
finding comments that you already sound

869
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:27,070
something like figure out and the first

870
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,280
obvious way is just using the up arrow

871
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,410
unlikely slowly going through all your

872
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,660
history like looking for these matches

873
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,640
this is actually not very efficient as

874
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,840
you probably guess so the bass has ways

875
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,540
to do this more easily there's the

876
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,310
history common that will bring your

877
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,650
history here I mean CCH and only prints

878
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,320
some of my history but if I say I want

879
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,660
you to print everything from the

880
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,220
beginning of time it will print

881
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,350
everything from the winning of whoever

882
00:41:56,350 --> 00:42:00,130
this history is and since this is a lot

883
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:00,730
of results

884
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,620
maybe we care about the ones where we

885
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,490
use the combat command to go from some

886
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,580
type of file to some other type of file

887
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,060
so image sorry then we're getting all

888
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,000
this results here about like only ones

889
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,920
that like mats this substrate what what

890
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,710
else would be even more the pyramids all

891
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,530
cells before we link control our who's

892
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,900
like a cave I need to do like backward

893
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,550
shirts and here we have like backward

894
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,070
shirts where we can like type convert

895
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,620
and it's finding the common that we just

896
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,690
type and if we just keep hitting like

897
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,390
controller it will kind of go through

898
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:43,120
these matches and one like it will let

899
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,400
us like react secure it in in place and

900
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,840
another thing that you can do relate to

901
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,640
that is you can use this really nifty

902
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,090
tool called FC F which is like a fuzzy

903
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,370
finder like you will let you let's say

904
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:58,960
it will let you do kind of like an

905
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,560
interactive grep and we could do for

906
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,090
example days where we can cut or example

907
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,540
is sh command now all printer to the

908
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,400
standard output and then we can pipe it

909
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,740
through FCF and you just get in all the

910
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,080
lines and then we can interactively kind

911
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,600
of look for the string that we care

912
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,380
about and the nice thing about f c/f is

913
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,420
that if you enable the default bindings

914
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:32,460
will bind to your controller cell

915
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,620
execution and now you can quickly and

916
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,800
dynamically like look for all the times

917
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,990
you try to combat of Oregon in your

918
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,350
history and it's also like fuzzy

919
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,600
matching whereas like by default grab

920
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,220
all these things you cannot have to

921
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,320
write a reg X like some expression that

922
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,620
we mad with in here here I'm just typing

923
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,170
in combat on ficon and it's just trying

924
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,810
to do the best scan doing the match in

925
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,220
the lines it has a lastly I have told

926
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,410
that probably you have already seen that

927
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,870
I've been using for not retyping this

928
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:11,170
extremely long commands is this history

929
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,220
substring search where the as I type in

930
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,970
my cell and both F fail to mention but

931
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,040
both base which I think was really

932
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,560
introduced this concept and CCH has a

933
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,659
really nice implementation

934
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:28,059
we'll let you do is as you type the

935
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:30,819
common it will dynamically like shirts

936
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:32,949
back in your history to the same command

937
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:35,889
I have like a common prefix and then if

938
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:41,409
you like it will change thus the match

939
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:43,719
list stops working and then as you do

940
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,630
like the right arrow you can like select

941
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,639
that comment and then like three execute

942
00:44:48,639 --> 00:45:09,909
it I've seen I want to stop a thing I

943
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:12,279
have a few minutes left so I'm gonna

944
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:15,759
cover and kind of a couple of tools to

945
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:18,189
do kind of really quick directory

946
00:45:18,189 --> 00:45:20,439
listing on directories navigation so you

947
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:24,669
can always use the - are two kind of

948
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:29,859
like recursively list of some directory

949
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:31,719
structure but that can be like

950
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,999
suboptimal like I cannot really make

951
00:45:33,999 --> 00:45:37,089
sense of this easily a there's like a

952
00:45:37,089 --> 00:45:40,839
code tool called tree I will be like

953
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:44,319
like the Matt more like friendly formal

954
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,149
like brain all the staff they will also

955
00:45:46,149 --> 00:45:48,639
color code based on here for example who

956
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:51,189
is blue because it's a directory and

957
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:53,829
like this is red because has execute

958
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:56,859
permissions but we can go even further

959
00:45:56,859 --> 00:46:00,339
than that they're like really nice tools

960
00:46:00,339 --> 00:46:03,249
like a recent one called brute that will

961
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:04,809
do the same thing but here for example

962
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:07,419
instead of doing this thing of listing

963
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:09,309
every single file for example in by we

964
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:12,159
have this a through J files it will say

965
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,249
out there like more unlisted here and I

966
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:17,799
can actually start typing and it will

967
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:20,949
again facili Matt's to the files that

968
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,439
are there and I can quickly select them

969
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:27,039
and navigate to do them so again it's

970
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:29,169
good to know that you're not like that

971
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:31,239
these things exist so you don't lose

972
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:34,809
unlike lots amount of time like going

973
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:39,299
for this five um there are also I think

974
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:42,400
install also like something more similar

975
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,949
to what we will expect your AOS to have

976
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:47,079
like now Toulouse or like one of like

977
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:50,079
the max finder that have like an

978
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,269
interactive input where you can just

979
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:57,569
like use your navigation arrows and

980
00:46:57,569 --> 00:47:01,089
quickly explore it might be overkill but

981
00:47:01,089 --> 00:47:03,999
you'll be surprised how quickly you can

982
00:47:03,999 --> 00:47:06,279
make sense of some directory structure

983
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:07,959
but just like navigating through it and

984
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:10,539
pretty much all of these tools will let

985
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,569
you edit like copy files if you just

986
00:47:13,569 --> 00:47:17,009
like look for the options for them a

987
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:20,259
last addendum is kind of going places

988
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:23,289
like we have CD and CD it's not like you

989
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:28,269
will give you two eller's places but

990
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:30,880
it's pretty handy if you can like

991
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,079
quickly go places you are either you

992
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:37,299
have been recently or that you go

993
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:40,869
frequently and you can do this in many

994
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:42,670
ways there's probably you can start

995
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:44,469
thinking oh I can make bookmarks I can

996
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:46,809
make like I can make aliases in the cell

997
00:47:46,809 --> 00:47:49,930
that we will cover at some point a sim

998
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:53,140
links but but this point like like

999
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,029
programmers have like built all these

1000
00:47:55,029 --> 00:47:56,949
tools so the promise have already figure

1001
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:59,670
out a really nice way of doing this and

1002
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,079
one way of doing this is using what is

1003
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,690
called Auto Jam which person is not

1004
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,079
loaded here this is concerning

1005
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,470
okay yeah no don't worry I will correct

1006
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,320
in the common line environment I don't

1007
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,420
know where isn't always well I think

1008
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,850
it's because I'd be say well be the

1009
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,730
controller and that also exit a fact

1010
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:29,680
that other parts of the script thing at

1011
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,230
this point if anyone has any questions

1012
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,330
they're like relate to this I'll be more

1013
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:36,580
than happy to answer them if anything

1014
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,610
was left unclear otherwise a there's

1015
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,640
like a bunch of exercises that we're all

1016
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,950
kind of touching on these topics and we

1017
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,690
encourage you to kind of try them and

1018
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,760
come to office hours where we can help

1019
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,550
you kind of figure out how to do them or

1020
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,710
like some like bass quakes they are not

1021
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,920
there
